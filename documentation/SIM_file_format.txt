<project name>.SIM - Detailed Simulation Results

The SIM file is the main results file of ContamX containing detailed airflow and contaminant results. The data in the SIM file is used by ContamW to display airflow results on the SketchPad, to display contaminant concentrations in the results display window, to create export and report files, and to generate charts of transient simulation results. Output is created at every output time step. Shorter output time steps allow you to see the results in more detail, but lead to larger simulation results file.
The format of this file has been slightly modified from the previous version to accommodate a greater number of building components (zones, paths, ducts, etc.). This is reflected in the "nr" fields that have changed from I2 to I4. It is still a binary file (not "human-readable" as opposed to a text file) to provide for faster access and smaller file size than a text file.
Several post-processor programs are available from the NIST website (www.bfrl.nist.gov/IAQanalysis) that can be used to read the .SIM file and generate various forms of output from it. These programs include: SimRead2, SimReadW and ContamRV.
SimRead2 is a DOS-based command-line program that can be used to generate user-selected output from the SIM file. Output is in the form of tab-delimitted files. SimRead2 can be used in a batch processing mode to minimize user-interaction when faced with the redundancy of manipulating multiple data sets.
SimReadW is a Windows program that can also generate user-selected output from the SIM file. SimReadW also provides the added capability of performing averaging of values over time and/or groups of building components, e.g., zones. It also enables the selection of either column-wise or row-wise orientation of the output.
The CONTAM Results Viewer, ContamRV, enables the visualization of contaminant concentrations on a color-coded image of the SketchPad. The program provides you with a color-coded display of zone contaminant concentrations, enables the animation of transient simulation results and displays zone concentrations in numerical format. A whole-building view is provided along with the ability to select individual levels of a project for detailed review.

File Format (binary):

The first 16 lines of the simulation results file contain data (32-bit integers) to help assure that the results apply to the project file currently in ContamW and to set the array sizes necessary to process the results.

    24 // CONTAM version number  id (I4)
    _nzone // number of airflow zones (excluding ambient) (I4)
    _npath // number of airflow paths (I4)
    _nctm // number of contaminants (I4)
    _njct // number of junctions and terminals (I4)
    _ndct // number of duct segments (I4)
    _time_list // listing time steps [s](I4)
    _date_0 // start of simulation - day of year (I4)
    _time_0 // start of simulation - time of day (I4)
    _date_1 // end of simulation - day of year (I4)
    _time_1 // end of simulation - time of day (I4)
    _pfsave // if true, write path flow results (I4)
    _zfsave // if true, write zone flow results (I4)
    _zcsave // if true, write zone contaminant results (I4)
    _nafnd // number of airflow nodes (zones + junctions) (I4)
    _nccnd // number of contaminant nodes (zones + junctions) (I4)
    _nafpt // number of airflow paths (paths + ducts) (I4)

This is followed by _nafnd lines of airflow node cross-reference data:
    typ // source of node [zone, junction or terminal] (I4)
    nr // zone, junction or terminal number (I4)

The next _nafnd lines give the contaminant node cross-reference data:
    typ // source of node [zone or junction] (I4)
    nr // zone, junction or terminal number (I4)

The next _nafpt lines give the airflow path cross-reference data:
    typ // source of path [path, duct, or leak] (I4)
    nr // path, duct, or leak number (I4)

The simulation results for each day consist of:

    The results for each time step consist of:

        A line of time and ambient data:

Programmer's Note: this file requires that the structures in ContamW and ContamX be compiled using no greater than 2-byte member alignment (under Visual C++). The file is unreadable if the default structure member alignment is used.
